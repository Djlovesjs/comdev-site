Working groups are informal groups who are working on specific tasks or
topics. Each group has a mission, and operates independently, reporting
back to the PMC on any activities that it wishes to make visible to the
Membership.

Working group definitions and other documents are contained in the
[comdev-working-groups GitHub
repo](https://github.com/apache/comdev-working-groups).

You are encouraged to participate in any WG that interests you, by
emailing
[dev@community.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@community.apache.org)
and introducing yourself, or by the mechanism defined in the individual
WG's README.

Current working groups include:

* wg-wg - Defining how working groups work, in general.
* wg-advisors - Advising PMCs on best practice
* wg-badging - Creation and maintenance of an accomplishment badging system
* wg-social - Orchestrating local gathering of Apache enthusiasts
* wg-social-media - Social media
* wg-website - Maintenance of the website
* wg-welcome - Helping projects, and the ASF in general, be more welcoming
