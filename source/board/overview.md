# What to Expect When You're Expecting to be a Director

What's involved in being a director? This document tries to give an
overview of the time commitment involved, and what the work looks like.

The official duties of the Board are defined [on the Apache Governance
website](https://apache.org/foundation/governance/board.html). You
should read that doc, and those to which it links, first.

This document tries to give a little more flavor, for the benefit of
someone who's considering running for their first term as a Director.

# Work Load

## Monthly meeting

As with most things in open source, you can spend as much time on them
as you want, and pursue your individual passions. However, being a
director does carry certain basic responsibilities.
You are expected to attend the board meeting, once a month. This meeting
can run from a half hour or more, depending on the issues to be discussed
in that particular month.

The shortest board meeting ran less than 15 minutes, while the longest
ones have been upwards of two hours. Typical meetings run about one hour.

Note that meeting times are chosen by the directors, and so tend to be
placed at times that are convenient to the majority of the currently
sitting directors. That is to say, the meetings tend to be at times that
are inconvenient to people living in underrepresented parts of the
world.

## Pre-meeting work

Most of the work of a board meeting happens before the meeting starts,
as discussed in the [formal
documentation](https://apache.org/foundation/governance/board.html). 

The Incubator report, in particular, consists of the podling reports
for all active incubation efforts, and so is effectively a dozen reports
on its own.

In a typical month, there will be between 70 and 90 individual board
reports. In addition to that, there are a dozen officers reports,
various special orders, and following up on action items.

If you review each of your shepherd projects in depth, and attempt to read
and comment on all of the other projects, this can take from several
hours to a couple of days.

Each director is assigned N/9 projects to shepherd, where N is the number 
of projects reporting that month. As of January 2024, this works out to 
roughly 7 or 8 shepherd projects per director.

## Post-meeting work

Reports that result in action items will require followup. This may just
be sending an email message, and then checking back on it a few days
later. Or it might be a significant quantity of work.

It is difficult to estimate what time will be required to handle these
items, as it varies greatly from one month to the next, and with the
complexity of the issues involved.

## Face-to-face meetings

Most years, the new board of directors will be asked to attend a
face-to-face meeting. This is in part to meet and learn how best to work
together. It's also largely to get an idea of what the various
directors' priorities are for that year.

This is typically a two-day meeting, plus travel time to and from the
meeting venue. The venue is chosen to minimize travel time and distance
for the largest number of participants.

Travel costs can be covered by the ASF, if needed, for directors and
officers who are expected to attend those face-to-face meetings.

## Between meetings

The board communicates on the board@apache.org mailing list, which is
visible to all ASF members and PMC chairs. On very rare occasions,
confidential discussions are handled on the board-private mailing list,
however, use of that is discouraged.

Directors are expected to check the board mailing list regularly, keep
up with discussions there, and weigh in on those discussions, as this is
where the business of the Foundation is conducted.

# Legal and Liability issues

Apache is a 501c3 non-profit. The Board of Directors have fidicuary
and legal responsibility for the operation of the Foundation.
